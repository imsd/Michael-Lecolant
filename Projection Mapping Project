In this project we did projection mapping. Our group created a Unity game that shoots balls into a 3 different spaces/containers that we had set up. The three spaces were seperately mapped on 3 different cardboard boxes stacked together. We then projected our game onto the three boxes to simulate the game taking place in real time.
