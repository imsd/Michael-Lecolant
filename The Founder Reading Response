The Founder game was very interesting.  I created a company called NoShow Inc because that's actually the name of Tshirt company my
friends and I started.  The game's concept was fascinating because it tries to show the work it goes into building up a tech or software
company.  I though that it was funny how at the begining of the game you select a business partner and could choose either people with marketable skills or someone that just had an inheritance to donate to the company.
